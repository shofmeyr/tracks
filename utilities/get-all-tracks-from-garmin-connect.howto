use the multilinks addon to firefox to save each page of activities links to the clipboard. Put them all in one file. Then iterate through the file with a script and call 

firefox http://connect.garmin.com/proxy/activity-service-1.0/tcx/activity/id?full=true

where id is the activity number.

Set firefox to not open a new tab on every call with

about:config
then set browser.link.open_newwindow to 1

Once you have a list of actitivty numbers, use the downloadlinks.py script.
