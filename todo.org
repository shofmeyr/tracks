* TODO put plots in separate class
  should be flexible to allow plotting of any two quantities against
  time, with two different y-axes
* TODO plot avhr, eff, avpace for all tracks with similar elev gain and dist with date on x axis
  have a param to define similar, eg 20% similar elev gain, and 20%
  similar dist. 
* TODO enable plots of many different track-level stats against each other, eg avpace vs elev gain
  should be options on the command line
